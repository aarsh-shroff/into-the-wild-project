# Into the Wild Project

This project made by Ron, Aarsh, Misal, and Georgie for our 12th grade English final is a game based on the classic Oregan Trail game. Our game incorporates themes and plot details from Into the Wild and captures the perils and struggles
that Christopher McCandless faced as he tried to survive in the wild.
